# Copywriting Guide for Product Landing Pages

*Based on "This Book Will Teach You How to Write Better" by Neville Medhora*

## Core Philosophy

**Communication is just getting information from one brain to another.** The words on a page can have an enormous impact. Use this power to help people, not to scam them.

---

## The Golden Rule

**No one cares about you. They only care about themselves.**

When people encounter your landing page, they immediately assess: "Is this USEFUL to me?"

**Don't write this:**
> "Welcome to Ace Tennis Coaching. We are dedicated to serving our customers. We have been focusing on quality service for years..."

**Write this instead:**
> "Every amateur tennis player has the exact same problem with their swing: They don't bend their elbow at the proper angle. This little body-hack will let you hit the ball harder without swinging harder..."

Always lead with the **benefit to the customer**, not information about your company.

## The AIDA Formula

Use this framework for every landing page section:

### A — Attention
Grab their attention immediately. Make them stop scrolling.

### I — Interest
Hook them with interesting facts, stats, or scenarios that relate to their problem.

### D — Desire
Make them *want* your product. Show them what life looks like with this solution. Use testimonials, paint the picture, quantify the transformation.

### A — Action
Tell them exactly what to do next. Be specific. Hold their hand through the process.

## Headline Formulas

### The Easy Formula
**[End result customer wants] + [Specific time period] + [Address objections]**

Examples:
- "Triple the conversions on your ecommerce store in 3 days — or I'll refund your money"
- "Wipe away your debt before your tax return is due so the IRS won't call"

### The Three Lenses
Run your headline through each lens and pick the strongest:

**Competitive:** Shows how to beat others
> "Download and steal all your competitors' profitable keywords"

**Benefit-Driven:** Shows direct benefits or uses testimonials
> "Within 2 weeks you'll be playing your favorite Beatles song on guitar!"

**Inspirational:** Shows that "even you" can achieve this
> "Even non-computer nerds can have a Wordpress site with zero technical hassle"

## Writing Style Rules

### Write Casual, Not Corporate
Pretend you're explaining your product to a friend over coffee. Record yourself doing it, then transcribe it. That's your copy.

**Boring:**
> "Our P-800 system delivers enterprise-grade computing solutions for high-volume data processing requirements."

**Casual:**
> "You know how toll roads take photos of your license plate? Our system processes 50 cars per second — competitors do only 10. That means our clients make 30% more revenue because the computer can actually keep up."

### Don't Write TOO Wacky
Casual ≠ clown. The goal is to SELL, not to be clever.

Before including a joke or quirky line, ask:
- "Is this adding to the user's knowledge?"
- "Am I helping them get through this?"

If it distracts → cut it. Be CLEAR, not clever.

---

## The Caveman Test

Review your copy with a "caveman voice." If any part triggers these reactions, fix it:

- "ME NO LIKE!" → Rewrite or delete
- "THIS MAKE ME BORED." → Cut it entirely  
- "ME NO UNDERSTAND!" → Simplify immediately

**Hard:**
> "AppSumo is a company with vested interests to bring its consumers high quality discounts on software-as-a-service products for the digital age."

**Easy:**
> "This fat-ass Sumo sends you one MASSIVE money-saving deal on tech stuff for startups... every day."

A good copywriter doesn't try to IMPRESS the reader — they try to INFORM with the fewest words possible.

## Know Your "Bob"

Create a composite of your ideal customer. Give them a name, job, income, fears, and desires.

Ask yourself:
- Male or female?
- How old?
- What's their income?
- What's their day like?
- What are their biggest fears?
- Why are they coming to YOU for help?
- What can you help them with most?

Then write as if you're talking directly to that one person.

---

## Short vs. Long Copy

**Match copy length to purchase complexity:**

| Product Type | Copy Length | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Simple, cheap, familiar (yo-yo, basic signup) | Short | People already know what it does |
| Complex, expensive, unfamiliar | Longer | Requires more convincing, more objection-handling |

**The rule:** Long copy is fine, as long as it's not *long-winded*. Every sentence must earn its place.

---

## Styling Your Text

### Use Visual Hierarchy
- **Bold** key phrases (once per paragraph max)
- Use staggered lists that create a visual "slope"
- Center important reveals for dramatic effect
- Break up walls of text

### The Staggered List
Order bullet points from shortest to longest to create momentum:

✓ Get more clients.  
✓ Teach people about me.  
✓ Show off my best articles.  
✓ Rank in the search engines.  
✓ Sell my products at all times of the day.  
✓ Answer commonly asked questions about my consulting business.

### Fonts & Readability
Keep it simple: Arial or Times New Roman, size 12, black text on white. Readability beats fancy.

## What Makes People Pay Attention

**New** — But novelty wears off quickly  
**Novel** — But it must attract the RIGHT attention  
**Helpful** — This is the winner. If you help people solve problems, they will pay attention.

Make your landing page genuinely useful. Even if someone doesn't buy, they should learn something valuable.

---

## Subject Lines & Headlines: Don't Be Scammy

Clickbait destroys trust. Keep headlines **catchy AND descriptive**.

**Bad (scammy):**
> "Warning, change your info immediately"

**Good (descriptive + intriguing):**
> "How to save 300 hours per year of frustration"

---

## Pre-Writing Checklist

Your mental state affects your writing. Before you write:

1. **Clean your space** — One minute, make it presentable
2. **Get your brain right** — Coffee, tea, or one beer (not more)
3. **Eat clean** — Mental clarity follows physical clarity
4. **Capture inspiration** — When ideas hit, write immediately
5. **Match the tone** — Feeling aggressive? Write aggressive copy. Use your mood.

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before publishing your landing page, verify:

- [ ] Does the headline promise a clear benefit?
- [ ] Is the first sentence about THEM, not you?
- [ ] Does it follow AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)?
- [ ] Would a caveman understand it?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place?
- [ ] Is the call-to-action crystal clear?
- [ ] Are you being helpful, not just selling?
- [ ] Would you read this if you weren't the one who wrote it?
