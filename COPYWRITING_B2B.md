## Core Philosophy

**"A copywriter is a salesperson behind a typewriter."**

The goal of advertising is not to entertain, amuse, or win awards—it is to **sell products**. Every word you write should move the reader closer to buying.

- Don't judge copy by how clever or artistic it is—judge it by whether it sells
- Simple, direct copy often outperforms fancy creative
- Creativity should enhance the selling message, not obscure it
- Your obligation is to increase sales at the lowest possible cost

## The Three Jobs of Copy

For copy to convince the consumer to buy, it must:

1. **Get attention** — Stop the scroll, make them look
2. **Communicate** — Convey information clearly
3. **Persuade** — Motivate action

## Headlines: The 80/20 Rule

> "On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."  
> — David Ogilvy

### The Four Functions of Headlines

1. **Get attention** — Appeal to self-interest or give news
2. **Select the audience** — Screen for qualified prospects
3. **Deliver a complete message** — For the 80% who only read headlines
4. **Draw readers into body copy** — Create curiosity

### 8 Proven Headline Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Direct** | "Pure Silk Blouses—30 Percent Off" |
| **Indirect** | "Ten Million to One, We Can Mix It" |
| **News** | "Introducing the New Citation II" |
| **How-to** | "How to Win Friends and Influence People" |
| **Question** | "Do You Close the Bathroom Door Even When You're the Only One Home?" |
| **Command** | "Put a Tiger in Your Tank" |
| **Reason-why** | "7 Reasons Why You Should Join the AIAA" |
| **Testimonial** | Customer quote in headline |

### The 4 U's Formula

Rate your headline 1-4 on each dimension:

- **Urgent** — Gives a reason to act now (include time element)
- **Unique** — Says something new or says it in a fresh way
- **Ultra-specific** — Concrete details, not vague promises
- **Useful** — Offers a clear benefit to the reader

*If your headline doesn't score 3+ on at least three U's, rewrite it.*

## Writing to Communicate: 11 Rules for Clarity

### 1. Put the Reader First
- Write to "you," not about "we"
- Focus on reader's interests and needs
- Ask: Would this persuade *me* to buy?

**Instead of:** "Bank Plan is state-of-the-art financial software..."  
**Write:** "Bank Plan can help you balance your books, manage cash flow, and track customers who haven't paid."

### 2. Organize Your Selling Points
- Lead with the most important benefit
- Secondary points come later
- Use the structure: Tell them what you'll tell them → Tell them → Tell them what you told them

### 3. Break Into Short Sections
- Use subheads for major sections
- Use bullets or numbers for lists
- Leave white space between paragraphs
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)

### 4. Use Short Sentences
- Aim for 14-16 words average
- Above 40 words becomes unreadable
- Vary length for rhythm
- Use fragments for emphasis: "Quickly. Easily. Economically."

### 5. Use Simple Words

| Don't Use | Use Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| utilize | use |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | start, do |
| terminate | end |
| procure | get |
| optimum | best |
| purchase | buy |
| subsequently | then, later |

### 6. Avoid Jargon
- Don't use technical terms unless 95%+ of readers will understand
- Don't use jargon unless it precisely communicates meaning
- When you must use technical terms, explain them

### 7. Be Concise

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| at this point in time | now |
| due to the fact that | because |
| in the event that | if |
| a large number of | many |
| in order to | to |
| free gift | gift |
| whether or not | whether |
| end result | result |

### 8. Be Specific
- "Lose 19 pounds in 3 weeks" beats "Lose weight fast"
- Include facts, figures, statistics
- Specifics build credibility

### 9. Go Straight to the Point
- Start selling with the first line
- Don't "warm up" with background
- Delete introductory paragraphs that don't sell

### 10. Write Conversationally
- Use pronouns (I, we, you, they)
- Use contractions (you're, it's, we've)
- Use colloquial expressions
- Write the way you talk

### 11. Avoid Sexist Language
- Use plurals: "doctors...their patients"
- Rewrite to avoid gender: "the manager called a staff meeting"
- Alternate he/she throughout
- Use inclusive job titles (firefighter, not fireman)

## Writing to Sell: The Motivating Sequence

### The 5-Step Formula

**1. Get Attention**
- Headline + visual
- Feature the single strongest benefit
- Don't save the best for last—lead with it

**2. Show a Need**
- Demonstrate why the reader needs this product
- Agitate the problem
- Make them feel the pain of not having it

**3. Satisfy the Need**
- Position your product as the solution
- Show how it solves their specific problem
- Connect features to their situation

**4. Prove Your Claims**
- Testimonials from real customers
- Case studies and success stories
- Statistics and test results
- Comparisons to competition
- Credentials and track record
- Guarantees

**5. Ask for Action**
- Tell them exactly what to do next
- Make it easy (clear button, simple form)
- Create urgency (deadline, limited quantity)
- Reduce risk (guarantee, free trial)

## Features vs. Benefits

> "Customers don't buy products. They buy what products do for them."

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 7½-inch graphite core | Long writing life |
| Hexagonal shape | Won't roll off your desk |
| Attached rubber eraser | Correct mistakes quickly |
| Made in USA | Quality you can trust |

**The translation exercise:**
1. List all product features in one column
2. For each feature, ask: "What does this do for the customer?"
3. Write the benefit in the second column
4. Lead with the most important benefit

---

## The Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Three requirements for a powerful USP:

1. **Makes a proposition** — "Buy this and you get this benefit"
2. **Must be unique** — Competition can't or doesn't offer it
3. **Must be powerful enough to move masses** — Not a trivial difference

### If Your Product Isn't Different

Four ways to differentiate similar products:

1. **Stress an underpublicized benefit** — Something true of all products in the category, but no one else talks about
2. **Dramatize a known benefit** — Present it in a compelling, memorable way
3. **Dramatize the name or package** — Make the brand itself memorable
4. **Build a brand personality** — Create emotional associations

---

## Know Your Customer: The BFD Formula

Before writing, understand your prospect's:

- **Beliefs** — What do they think? What's their attitude toward the problem?
- **Feelings** — How do they feel? Confident? Anxious? Frustrated?
- **Desires** — What do they want? What change are they seeking?

### 22 Reasons People Buy

Copy motivators to consider:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| To be liked | To save money | To be distinctive |
| To be appreciated | To save time | To be happy |
| To be right | To make work easier | To have fun |
| To feel important | To be secure | To gain knowledge |
| To make money | To be attractive/sexy | To be healthy |
| For convenience | Out of fear | Out of greed |
| To be comfortable | To gratify curiosity | Out of guilt |

---

## Copy Length: When to Write Long vs. Short

### The Copy Length Grid

| | HIGH Involvement | LOW Involvement |
|---|---|---|
| **HIGH Emotion** | LONG copy (engagement ring) | MEDIUM copy (designer jeans) |
| **LOW Emotion** | MEDIUM copy (business software) | SHORT copy (paper clips) |

### Factors Favoring Long Copy

- Higher price point
- Selling directly (not generating leads)
- Audience has time and interest to read
- Product is a "want" not a "need"
- Product is unfamiliar

### Factors Favoring Short Copy

- Lower price point
- Generating leads (more info comes later)
- Busy audience
- Product is a necessity
- Product is familiar/well-known

**The rule:** Include as many facts as it takes to make the sale—no more, no less.

Don't entertain. Sell.  
Don't assume. Research.  
Don't hope. Test.
