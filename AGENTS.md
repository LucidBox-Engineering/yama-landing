Smart Access. Same Intercom.

## Hero Copy

Transform your existing dialer intercom into a modern Smart Access system—without replacing hardware.

Yama upgrades the intercoms you already have, giving you cloud-based access management, a digital tenant directory, and real-time control across your entire portfolio.

## Built for Multifamily Operations

Yama is purpose-built for owners and managers of multifamily properties who want modern access control—without the cost, disruption, or risk of replacing existing intercom systems.

## Use Cases

### Tenant Access Management

**Manage tenant access instantly from anywhere.**

Update phone numbers, add or remove residents, and keep directories current—without on-site visits or reprogramming your intercom.

Deliver faster service to tenants while reducing administrative overhead for your team.

### Staff & Vendor Access Management

Create unique, scheduled access codes for staff and vendors such as cleaners, maintenance teams, technicians, and property managers.

Control who has access, when they have it, and easily revoke it when work is complete—all from the Yama Web App.

## Key Features

1. **Cloud-based Intercom Management** - Manage your intercom through the Yama Web App, accessible anywhere with an internet connection.
2. **Instant Remote Updates** - Changes take effect immediately, with no waiting and no intercom reprogramming.
3. **Multiple Residence Phone Numbers** - Everyone in a single residence can receive intercom calls on their own phone - no intercom reprogramming required.
4. **Long-Distance Number Support** – Allow tenants to receive intercom calls on any phone number, even if your intercom can’t dial outside its local area code.
5. **Multi-Region Support** – Manage access consistently across properties in multiple regions from a single system.
6. **Digital Tenant Directory** – A QR-code–based tenant directory that updates automatically in real time as residents change.

## Getting Started

1. Create your building and its residences and add your intercom’s dial-out number in the Yama Web App.
2. Yama generates and assigns unique phone numbers to each residence.
3. Program the Yama phone numbers into your intercom.
Congratulations - you’ve just programmed your intercom for the last time!
4. Manage tenants, staff, and vendor access anytime, anywhere using the Yama web portal.
